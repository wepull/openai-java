================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Import Statement
Issue: The code contains a syntax error with multiple import statements on the same line separated by commas, which could lead to a failure to compile or the use of an unintended version of a class if the statement is manually corrected without proper verification.
Solution: Separate each import statement onto its own line and ensure that the correct classes are being imported.

Vulnerability: Improper Use of Annotations
Issue: Annotations like @JsonIgnore, @JsonProperty, @Data, and @NoArgsConstructor are present in the import section but are not used correctly. They should annotate class properties or methods, not be included with import statements.
Solution: Remove the annotations from the import section and use them properly within the class to annotate class members or methods as intended.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation
Issue: The 'name' parameter in the Builder's 'name' method is not validated, which could lead to security risks such as injection attacks if the input is not properly sanitized.
Solution: Implement input validation for the 'name' parameter to ensure that it meets the expected format and does not contain malicious data.

Vulnerability: Missing Access Modifiers
Issue: The 'name' method of the Builder class does not specify an access modifier, which means it has package-private access by default. This could lead to unintended exposure of the method within the package.
Solution: Define an explicit access modifier for the 'name' method to ensure it is not unintentionally exposed or accessible from outside the intended scope.

Vulnerability: Inconsistent Coding Practices
Issue: The use of semicolons after annotations in the import section is inconsistent with Java syntax and could lead to confusion or errors during code maintenance.
Solution: Follow Java syntax rules consistently and remove the semicolons after annotations in the import section.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Name Assignment

Details:  
  TestName: nameAssignsValueSuccessfully
  Description: This test verifies that the name method correctly assigns a non-null, non-empty string to the 'name' field and returns the Builder object for chaining.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Builder instance and a valid string to assign to the name.
  Act: Call the name method with the valid string.
  Assert: Check that the 'name' field is set to the given string and that the method returns the Builder instance.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the 'name' field is correctly assigned, which is vital for the Builder to function as expected. It also ensures that the method supports fluent interface design by returning the Builder object.

Scenario 2: Null Name Assignment

Details:  
  TestName: nameHandlesNullValue
  Description: This test checks how the name method handles a null value being passed as the name argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Builder instance and a null string reference.
  Act: Call the name method with the null string.
  Assert: Check that the 'name' field is set to null without throwing an exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that the method is null-safe and does not break the Builder pattern when provided with a null argument. This is essential for ensuring the robustness of the method.

Scenario 3: Empty String Name Assignment

Details:  
  TestName: nameHandlesEmptyStringValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the name method when an empty string is passed as the name argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Builder instance and an empty string.
  Act: Call the name method with the empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the 'name' field is set to the empty string and that the Builder object is returned.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks if the method can handle empty strings, which might be an expected scenario depending on the business logic. Ensuring that empty strings are handled correctly can prevent potential bugs or unexpected behavior.

Scenario 4: Name Assignment With Whitespace

Details:  
  TestName: nameHandlesWhitespaceValue
  Description: This test ensures that the name method can handle strings that consist of whitespace characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Builder instance and a string containing only whitespace.
  Act: Call the name method with the whitespace string.
  Assert: Verify that the 'name' field is set to the whitespace string and that the method returns the Builder instance.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method can handle strings of whitespace, which may be considered valid input in some contexts. It's important to test this scenario to understand how the method behaves with such input.

Scenario 5: Chaining Builder Methods After Name Assignment

Details:  
  TestName: nameSupportsMethodChaining
  Description: This test confirms that after setting the name, the Builder can still chain other Builder methods seamlessly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Builder instance, a valid name string, and prepare another method call for chaining.
  Act: Call the name method and then chain another Builder method.
  Assert: Verify that the chained method call can be executed without any issues and that the Builder's state is correctly updated.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the Builder pattern is correctly implemented and that method chaining is not disrupted by the name assignment. This is crucial for maintaining a fluent interface and usability of the Builder class.
